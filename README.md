# Single Shot MultiBox Detector (TensforFlow 2 & Keras)
Keras implementation of [Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325). Unlike the original SSD model, which uses VGG16 as the "base network" for feature extraction, I'm using Inception V3 here (specifically, I've used the version with pre-trained weights available under [`tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/InceptionV3)). Apart from this, there are other small differences between this version and the original SSD model, such as the data augmentation strategy.
